"""
This module defines the Calculator class, which provides 
basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) 
using the Decimal data type for high-precision arithmetic.

The Calculator class leverages the Calculation class to perform operations 
and the Calculations class to manage a history of all performed calculations. 
Each operation is defined as a static method that delegates to a 
private _perform_operation method.

Imports:
    - decimal.Decimal: For high-precision arithmetic operations.
    - typing.Callable: For type hinting callable objects.
    - calculator.calculations.Calculations: Manages the history of all calculations.
    - calculator.operations: Contains the basic arithmetic 
    operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
    - calculator.calculation.Calculation: Represents a single calculation.
